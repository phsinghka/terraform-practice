# Terraform Learning Path

Welcome to my Terraform learning journey! This repository contains a structured learning path that starts with basic projects and gradually tackles more complex scenarios to cover all key concepts of Terraform. Each project is designed to build upon the previous one, increasing in complexity and depth.

## Learning Path

- **Concepts Covered**: Conditional logic in Terraform, `count` and `for_each` with conditions.

### **Project 13: Dependency Management**
- **Objective**: Explicitly manage dependencies between resources using `depends_on`.
- **Concepts Covered**: Dependency management, implicit vs explicit dependencies.

### **Project 14: Environment-Specific Configurations**
- **Objective**: Set up configurations for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- **Concepts Covered**: Workspaces, environment-specific variables and configurations.

### **Project 15: Secret Management**
